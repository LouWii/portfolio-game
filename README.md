# My game dev portfolio

My portfolio website is kind of boring, so I've decided to make it a bit more fun. I've transformed it into an HTML game (well, that's the goal anyway).

## Dev

Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/LouWii/portfolio-game.git`

Install NPM dependencies

`npm install`

Run the dev server

`npm run dev`

Build for release

`npm run deploy`

## Boilerplate

The project is based on [that boilerplate](https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack).

The original README is [here](README-ORIG.md).

## Graphics

Use https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker to pack all our sprites and resources

Go to [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-2d) to get free assets/sprites

Use [Tiled Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) to easily create levels and follow [that tutorial](https://gamedevacademy.org/html5-phaser-tutorial-top-down-games-with-tiled/) or [this one](http://baraujo.net/integrating-tiled-maps-with-phaser/) to create a level for phaser.


## Phaser

We're using the [Phaser JS framework](http://phaser.io), version [3](http://phaser.io/phaser3).
