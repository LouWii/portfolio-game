# My game dev portfolio

My portfolio website is kind of boring, so I've decided to make it a bit more fun. I've transformed it into an HTML game (well, that's the goal anyway).

## Dev

Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/LouWii/portfolio-game.git`

Install NPM dependencies

`npm install`

Run the dev server

`npm run dev`

Build for release

`npm run deploy`

## Boilerplate

The project is based on [that boilerplate](https://github.com/nkholski/phaser3-es6-webpack).

The original README is [here](README-ORIG.md).
